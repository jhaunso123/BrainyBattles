Algorithms Project IEU 2023

A Breif Overview:
This project has been created to teach kids educational material from a young age in a fun way. This has all been programmed by our fantastic group, for a Algorithms and Data Structures course in IE University taught by Antonio Lopez Rosell. This is our first time creating a project in python at this scale, so dont scrutinize us too hard. :)


What exactly does the code do?
When you run the code you will me met with a welcome page, which allows you to login and register. After logging in or registering, you will choose your year, level and prefered subject. This will effect the types of questions you will be asked. Now you will be prompted to answer questions one at a time. Based on your answer you will be told if you are correct or incorrect.

HOW TO USE 
Implementation may vary depending on your preffered python app. In the case of pycharm (and probably others) you must simply upload the main folder into a new project. When this is done you must run the file "projet fr +.py". You may be prompted that the code cannot run, this is likely because you have not installed the nessecary packages. In this situation copy and past the line below into your terminal to download the packages. Once the packages have been installed you will see that the code is running on a website that you can acsess by clicking the link that will be shown in the console. Once you click on the link you will be on the website and can explore the project.


Note:
There have been some issues with running the code on different OS. In some cases code written by people on Windows does not run on Mac. We are doing our best to fix this issue but it has proved quite challenging. By the submission date this will be fixed.
