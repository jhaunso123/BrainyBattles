Algorithms Project IEU 2023

A Breif Overview:
This project has been created to teach kids educational material from a young age in a fun way. This has all been programmed by our fantastic group, for a Algorithms and Data Structures course in IE University taught by Antonio Lopez Rosell. This is our first time creating a project in python at this scale, so dont scrutinize us too hard. :)

This will effect the types of questions you will be asked. Now you will be prompted to answer questions one at a time. Based on your answer you will be told if you are correct or incorrect.
